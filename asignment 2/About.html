      <h2 class="fade-in">Why This Exists</h2>
      <p class="quote">“Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.” – Carl Jung</p>

      <p>This isn’t a portfolio. This isn’t even a website. It’s a ritual. A mirror. A slow exhale carved into code. Every word here was written in silence, rewritten in pain, and designed with stillness.</p>

      <p>I built <strong>Inner Depths</strong> as a space to explore philosophy, psychology, and the shadows within. Each page reflects a stage in personal integration. I am not an expert. I am not a guru. I am a seeker — just like you.</p>

      <p>If these words meant anything to you, then perhaps it wasn’t just about me. Perhaps some forgotten part of you came to the surface. Welcome back.</p>

        <p><strong>🌀 Footnote:</strong> This site is unfinished. Just like the soul it came from. And that’s exactly why it matters.</p>
