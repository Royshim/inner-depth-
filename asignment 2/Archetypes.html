      <h2>The Inner Cast – Jungian Archetypes</h2>
      <p class="quote">“The privilege of a lifetime is to become who you truly are.” – Carl Jung</p>
      <p>
        These are not characters in a book — they are fragments of your inner landscape. Carl Jung called them archetypes: universal roles embedded in our psyche. They live in myth, in dreams, in every choice we make. Here are six that shape your personal story.

      <div class="archetypes-grid">
        <div class="archetype-card">
          <img src="images/shadow.png" alt="Shadow">
          <h3>The Shadow</h3>
          <p>All the truths we bury. Our fears, instincts, and suppressed memories. The Shadow is not evil — it's honest. It asks to be seen, not shamed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="archetype-card">
          <img src="images/hero.png" alt="Hero">
          <h3>The Hero</h3>
          <p>The inner warrior. It rises through adversity, not for glory, but for transformation. The Hero teaches you how to suffer with meaning.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="archetype-card">
          <img src="images/sage.png" alt="Sage">
          <h3>The Sage</h3>
          <p>The quiet observer. The one who seeks truth above comfort. The Sage teaches by presence, not performance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="archetype-card">
          <img src="images/lover.png" alt="Lover">
          <h3>The Lover</h3>
          <p>Passion, connection, vulnerability. The Lover is the part of you that longs to merge — with people, with art, with meaning.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="archetype-card">
          <img src="images/innocent.png" alt="Innocent">
          <h3>The Innocent</h3>
          <p>The untainted. The pure curiosity. It reminds us of trust, wonder, and joy before fear arrived. The Innocent sees the world as it could be.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="archetype-card">
          <img src="images/outlaw.png" alt="Outlaw">
          <h3>The Outlaw</h3>
          <p>The rule-breaker. The one who tears down illusions and lies. The Outlaw rebels not out of rage — but for rebirth. Sometimes you have to burn to rebuild.</p>
